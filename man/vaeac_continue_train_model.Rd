\usage{
vaeac_continue_train_model(
  explanation,
  epochs_new,
  lr_new = NULL,
  x_train = NULL,
  save_data = FALSE,
  verbose = 0,
  seed = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{explanation}{A \code{\link[=explain]{explain()}} object and \code{vaeac} must be the used approach.}

\item{epochs_new}{Positive integer. The number of extra epochs to conduct.}

\item{lr_new}{Positive numeric. If we are to overwrite the old learning rate in the adam optimizer.}

\item{x_train}{A data.table containing the training data. Categorical data must have class names \eqn{1,2,\dots,K}.}

\item{save_data}{Logical (default is \code{FALSE}). If \code{TRUE}, then the data is stored together with
the model. Useful if one are to continue to train the model later using \code{\link[=vaeac_continue_train_model]{vaeac_continue_train_model()}}.}

\item{verbose}{Boolean. An integer specifying the level of verbosity. Use \code{0} (default) for no verbosity,
\code{1} for low verbose, and \code{2} for high verbose.}

\item{seed}{Positive integer (default is \code{1}). Seed for reproducibility. Specifies the seed before any randomness
based code is being run.}
}
\value{
A list containing the training/validation errors and paths to where the vaeac models are saved on the disk.
}
\description{
Function that loads a previously trained vaeac model and continue the training, either
on new data or on the same dataset as it was trained on before. If we are given a new dataset, then
we assume that new dataset has the same distribution and one_hot_max_sizes as the original dataset.
