\title{Preprocess Data for the VAEAC approach}
\usage{
VAEAC_preprocess_data(data, transform_all_continuous_features = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{matrix/data.frame/data.table containing the training data. Only the features and
not the response.}

\item{transform_all_continuous_features}{Boolean. If we are to log transform all continuous
features before sending the data to VAEAC. VAEAC creates unbounded values, so if the continuous
features are strictly positive, as for Burr and Abalone data, it can be advantageous to log-transform
the data to unbounded form before using VAEAC. If TRUE, then \code{VAEAC_postprocess_data} will
take the exp of the results to get back to strictly positive values.}
}
\value{
list containing data which can be used in VAEAC, maps between original and new class
names for categorical features, one_hot_max_sizes, and list of information about the data.
}
\description{
VAEAC only supports numerical values. This function converts categorical features
to numerics with class labels 1,2,...,K, and keeps track of the map between the original and
new class labels. It also computes the one_hot_max_sizes.
